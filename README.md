# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple, classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players can take turns to play and the game declares the winner based on the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

## Features

- **Two-player Mode**: Players take turns marking the grid as "O" or "X".
- **Winning Logic**: Automatically checks for win patterns and displays the winner.
- **Blur Effect**: Blurs the game grid when a winner is declared to highlight the result.
- **Reset Game**: Resets the game and allows for a new round.

## How to Play

1. Player 1 is assigned "O" and Player 2 is assigned "X".
2. Players take turns by clicking on empty squares.
3. The first player to align three of their symbols (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
4. Click the reset button to start a new game at any time.
